# Teuton Panel

**teuton-panel** is a graphical front-end for [teuton](https://github.com/dvarrui/teuton).

It includes [**teuton gem**](https://rubygems.org/gems/teuton) and uses [**jruby**](https://www.jruby.org/) to run it (so there's no need to install *teuton* separately nor Ruby).

- [**v0.6.0**](https://github.com/teuton-software/teuton-panel/releases/tag/v0.4.0) includes **teuton 2.2.0** and **jruby 9.2.9.0**
