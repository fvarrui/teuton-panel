To define and run our activity test we use the next DSL keywords:

## Definition instructions

These are the main DSL key words, usefull to define items to be evaluated.

| DSL                            | Description |
| :----------------------------- | :---------- |
| [group](definition/group.md)   | Define a group of items to check. |
| [target](definition/target.md) | Define a target. This is the item to be checked. |
| [goto](definition/goto.md)     | Execute command into remote host. |
| [run](definition/run.md)       | Execute command into localhost. |
| [result](definition/result.md) | Contain the output of previous `goto` order. |
| [expect](definition/expect.md) | Check the obtained result with the expected value. |

---

## Execution instructions

DSL key word related with reports and information.

| DSL                           | DescripciÃ³n                              |
| :---------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| [play](execution/play.md)     | Run the challenge.                       |
| [show](execution/show.md)     | Show the results on screen.              |
| [export](execution/export.md) | Make reports with the results of every evaluation. |
| [send](execution/send.md)     | Send copy of report file to remote host. |

## Setting instructions

| DSL                   | DescripciÃ³n                                    |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| [get](setting/get.md) | Read param value from configuration file.      |
| [set](setting/set.md) | Set new param value for running configuration. |

---
## Ruby language

It is possible to use ruby language programming structures, in the definition of challenges (iterators, arrays, etc.). Very useful when we have repetitive lines.

Example, how to create 4 target evaluation using an Array:
```ruby
users = ['Obiwan', 'Yoda', 'Maul', 'Vader']

users.each do |user|
  target "Exist user #{user}"
  goto :host1, :exec => "id #{user}"
  expect_one user
end
```
